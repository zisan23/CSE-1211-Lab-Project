## Details

Running Is Our Therapy (R.I.O.T.) is an SDL-based survival game written in C/C++ language. Simple, clear, and easily customizable code made this game distinctive. This game has attractive features and a good user interface. Use of keyboard and mouse interaction has made the game more enjoyable. The game is not an infinite game, so we decided to make 2 levels of the game and completing all the levels with maximum collection of point will be awarded a "Champion Crown". Based on the concept of “Jurassic Survival” like avoiding obstacles, hunting for food, dodging the enemies etc. we add fully new theme that made the game distinctive.
